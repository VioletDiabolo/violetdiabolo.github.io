I am a vertax one-trick (which means that you should be very careful near me when I'm yoyoing), but I'm currently working on 3D and trying to learn more integrals! In my free time I like to play Tetris (modern, not NES) and spin other non yoyo props like poi, whip, staff, or ropedart. Sometimes you'll catch me playing with fire :)"
